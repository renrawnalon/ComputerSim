# ComputerSim
A simple android project that simulates a computer designed to run integer arithmatic.

## Assumptions
This simulator only operates on Integers by design and the remainder of any uneven division is rounded off. This could be easily abstracted to  work with floating point values as mentions in the Improvments section.


## Improvements.

### Calculation Saving
Since the computer is capable of executing functions it would be interesting to allow the user to save calculations. These could be registered in the computer as functions that could be called with a new interface that allows the user to access their saved calculations.

### Operating on floating point values
Currently, the system only allows interaction with integers by design. This makes the division function of the calculator very limited. Ideally, the computer should take Doubles as input in order to do more meaningful computation.

### Unit Tests
Unit tests will be implemented in a future release.
